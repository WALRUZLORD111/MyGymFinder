My gym finder is a web application that has a tool that allows you to search for Martial arts gyms in your area and filter based on the type of services offered at that gym. For example, you can filter for gyms that focus on Amateur Boxing and this tool will only show gyms with a proven record in Amateur Boxing. This tool by no means replaces doing your own research.
